## Raylib - SocketIO - Multiplayer Online Stratego

I'm in the process of building a Multiplayer online version of the board game Stratego. It currently builds for both native C++ and WASM, which allows users to play in the browser and as a desktop application. 
I have written a responsive UI wrapper for the raylib GUI framework. I currently have a room system, join and host functionality and the ability to place pieces on your side. However, you can't play the game as I'm not quite finished yet.
